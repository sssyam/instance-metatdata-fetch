## Instance Meta-Data Fetch

Got bored <br>
Creates an updates the directory with the EC2 instance Meta-Data

Needs to be run as root as of now!
Will Update to run as a normal user.
  - changing the directory would do it.
  
## SIN:
  - Hardcoded the directory
  - Used python's OS library's native function
  - Did not create a daemon for it
